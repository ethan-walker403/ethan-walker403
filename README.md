I write and curate notes around slope-style browser games.

I’m interested in how simple mechanics create difficulty through speed, balance, and momentum.
Most of my writing focuses on player learning, repetition, and why certain games feel brutal but fair.

I also maintain a small collection of slope games that are playable directly in the browser.
